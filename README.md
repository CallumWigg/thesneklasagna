A datapack for the Snek Lasagna minecraft server, based around converting various mod recipes to Create Mod based ingredients and methods.

Includes recipe changes for Chunk Loaders, Computer Craft, Metal Barrels, More Minecarts, Pam's HarvestCraft Crops and Food Core, Simply Tea, and Storage Drawers.

Designed for Create 1.16.5-v0.3.2d, and the respective versions of the other mods that were around at that time.

### NO LONGER ACTIVELY BEING MAINTAINED
Create, and the other mods, have been updated many many times since this was created. It is likely not compatible with any of the current updates, and getting compatibility working will be tough.  
```manifest.json``` can be imported into Curseforge client to get the compatible mods/versions.
